# Architecture

In celebration of the pride month, I have created this fully decentralized LGBTQ+ forum where users can sign in using their metamask wallet. Users can also mint an NFT profile image using the `mint` button. This app was developed using Next JS and deployed to Vercel. Please feel free to test out functionalities. It is currently a work in progress. I hope to make this more sophisticated soon.
